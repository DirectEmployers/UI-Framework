Global UI Framework
(C) 2011-2012 DirectEmployers Foundation

Documentation is still in its infancy. Please contact Jason Sole with any questions: jason -at- directemplpoyersfoundation.org.

/framework
contains the actual files for inclusion in the UI. This broken into 4 main areas:

css
The css files need to make the foundation work. This includes the base bootstrap files (which are included instead of hotlinked in order to control unintended effects due to changes in the bootstrap project).

js
The base javascript files. This is 95% jQuery right now, with a few custom functions. jQuery is included instead of hot liked for the same reason as Bootstrap.

images
Any images required by the css and javascript to style elements.

django
Template and settings helpful to using the framework in a django project.

/documentation
Contains all documentation and examples
