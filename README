Global UI Framework
(C) 2011-2013 DirectEmployers Foundation

Version 2 now available (1/3/13).
Version 2 of the UI Framework is now in place. This version:
 - adds support for Bootstrap 2.2.1
 - depricates the 16 column grid in favor of the bootstrap 12 column grid
 - reduces the number of @import actions to reduce css load time

Documentation is still in its infancy. Please contact Jason Sole with any questions: jason@directemplpoyersfoundation.org.

/framework
contains the actual files for inclusion in the UI. This broken into 4 main areas:

css
The css files need to make the foundation work. This includes the base bootstrap files (which are included instead of hotlinked in order to control unintended effects due to changes in the bootstrap project).

js
The base javascript files. This is 95% jQuery right now, with a few custom functions. jQuery is included instead of hot liked for the same reason as Bootstrap.

images
Any images required by the css and javascript to style elements.

django
Template and settings helpful to using the framework in a django project.

/documentation
Contains all documentation and examples
